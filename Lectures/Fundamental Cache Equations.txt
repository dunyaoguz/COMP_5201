Fundamental Cache Equations
___________________________

Every cache is an array of _elements_.  What an element is, and how a
cache-array index is computed from the relevant memory address, differ between
two cache families.  Both families will be introduced.  However, the unit of
data transfer between memory and cache, for both families, is the _line_.
Memory is byte addressed, and a line contains some fixed number of bytes,
chosen by the cache designer.  The cache equations below specify which lines
--which might be called memory slices---are to be copied into which cache
elements, i.e., which cache-array elements.

Generally true (both families)
______________

0) byte number   = memory address `mod` the number of bytes
                   in a line

1) line number   = memory address `div` the number of bytes
                   in a line

2) element index = line number `mod` the number of elements
                   in the cache

3) tag value     = line number `div` the number of elements
                   in the cache

In a direct-mapped cache, the array elements are _frames_,
but, in an m-way set-associative cache, the array elements
are _sets_ of frames.

When a line is copied from memory into the cache, it is,
according to these equations, placed in one of the cache
elements.

Because many lines are mapped to the same element, a tag
value is used to identify which line got copied.  This is
required to be able to look up lines in caches.

This is the punch line.  When you understand these equations,
you understand how caches work.

I will rewrite the last two equations in a family-specific way.

family 1: direct-mapped cache
_____________________________

2) frame index   = line number `mod` the number of frames
                   in the cache

3) tag value     = line number `div` the number of frames
                   in the cache

family 2: set-associative cache
_______________________________

2) set index     = line number `mod` the number of sets
                   in the cache

3) tag value     = line number `div` the number of sets
