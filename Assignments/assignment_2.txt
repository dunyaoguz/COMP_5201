1. [24 marks] Digital Logic.

a) 'X' is the ternary connective such that 'Xpqr' is logically equivalent to
'p /\ (p + q + r)'. '+' is 'xor'.  'F' and 'T' denote the 0-ary connectives
'false' and true, respectively.  Whenever possible, put letters in
alphabetical order, and put letters before any 0-place connectives.

Using {'X', 'F', 'T'}, synthesize:                  ~p |= =| X ____ ____ ____

Using {'X', 'T'}, synthesize:                   p /\ q |= =| X ____ ____ ____

Using {'X', '~', 'T'}, synthesize:         p \/ q |= =| ____ X ____ ____ ____

b) 'Y' is the ternary connective such that 'Ypqr' is logically equivalent to
'p /\ (q <--> r)'.  'p <--> q' is true iff 'p' and 'q' have the same truth
value.  'F' and 'T' denote the two 0-ary connectives 'false' and 'true',
respectively.  Whenever possible, put letters in alphabetical order, and put
letters before any 0-place connectives.

Using {'Y', 'F', 'T'}, synthesize:                  ~p |= =| Y ____ ____ ____

Using {'Y', 'F', 'T'}, synthesize:              p /\ q |= =| Y ____ ____ ____

Using {'Y', '~', 'F'}, synthesize:          p \/ q |= =| ___ Y ____ ____ ____

2. [16 marks] Binary and Hexadecimal Numbers.

Convert each of the following six binary or hexadecimal natural numbers into
decimal.  Show work.  For the last number, show either scientific notation
with six decimal places, or the exact integer.

a) Binary numbers: 1111, 1111 1110, 1111 1110 1101 0111

b) Hexadecimal numbers: af, afba, afba 51de

3. [25 marks] Fractional Numbers and Blackboard Notation.

Infinite binary expansions of rational numbers are either pure recurring or
mixed recurring depending on whether the cycle starts immediately after the
point.

a) [math] Show the infinite binary expansion of 6 4/9 without normalization.

b) [math] Show this infinite binary expansion in hexadecimal without
normalization.

c) [math] Show the infinite binary expansion of 6 4/9 with normalization.  Do
not forget the scale factor.  (This is a _scaled_ infinite binary expansion).

d) [math] Show this infinite binary expansion in hexadecimal.  Again, do not
forget the scale factor, which may be shown in decimal.

e) Show the normalized (binary) blackboard notation that best approximates
6 4/9.  The fractional field is 16 bits.  Show all 16 bits.  Now, show just
the 16-bit (4-hexit) fractional field in hexadecimal.

4. [15 marks] Integer Multiplication I.

a) Multiply the following 10-bit binary natural numbers.  The multiplicand
is 10011 11100 (27c hex) and the multiplier is 11010 (1a hex).   Show, in
hexadecimal, i) the initial value of the accumulator, and ii) each term
added to the accumulator, and the partial sum after the addition.  The last
addition yields the final value.

b) Redo the multiplication steps exactly as in question 4 a), but initialize
the accumulator to s = 11011 (1b hex) instead of 0.  Show the same
intermediate and final values.  (This is called "fused multiply-add"). 

5. [20 marks] Integer Multiplication II.

a) Show that, regardless of the initial n-bit value of the accumulator, the
fused multiply-add result of two n-bit natural-number operands is always
representable in 2n bits.  Now, suppose n = 16.  Starting from the largest
possible FMA result, what is the hexadecimal representation of the largest
n = 16-bit number that can _still_ be added without producing overflow?

b) A modular-adder device 'M' operates with 16-bit registers.  You give it
two 16-bit natural numbers 'a' and 'b'.  It adds them, divides by 2^16,
keeps the quotient 'q' a secret, and publishes the remainder 'r'.  Hint:
Before answering, experiment with small addition tables.

i)  If a = 31,465 and r = 53,576, what are 'b' and 'q'?

ii) If a = 35,492 and r = 11,087, what are 'b' and 'q'?
