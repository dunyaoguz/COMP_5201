MIPS is a RISC assembly language


Registers are the fastest memory in the computer
Some of them are reserved but most of them are accessible to the programmer

They are like variables.
Variables are stored in RAM (Random Access Memory) while registers are stored in the processor.

We can manipulate registers directly with assembly.

$zero can't be used


$at is Assembler Temporary it is used by the assembler, you don't have permission to use this one

$v0 and $v1 are used to return arguments. They have a special purpose. 
They allow to return informations back.

$ax registers are used for arguments. Whenever you want to pass arguments to a function you use them.

$s and $t are Temporary

$tx registers are used to store information. Any type of information.
They follow a convention. These registers can be modified by a function.
They are not preserved accross call


$sx are similar to the t registers. They registers allow you to save the value of the color.
You are supposed to save them to the stack.
They are preserved accross call

$k0 and $k1 are used for the kernel

______________________________________HELLO WORLD PROGRAM______________________________________ 

.data
	myMessage: .asciiz "Hello World !\n"


.text
	li $v0, 4
	la $a0, myMessage
	syscall

______________________________________HELLO WORLD EXPLAINED______________________________________ 


Two sections of the program:

.data
	The information is stored in Random Access Memory

.text
	Contains the instructions
		
	
	When you want to print out text:

		Put the value 4 in $v0:			li $v0, 4
			-> The system will know you want to print a value on the screen
		What value ? myMessage from RAM		la $a0, myMessage

			-> myMessage 

	li: Load Immediate
	la: Load Address

______________________________________PRINT A CHARACTER______________________________________ 

.data

	myCharacter: .byte 'm'
	
.text

	li $v0, 4
	la $a0, myCharacter
	syscall
